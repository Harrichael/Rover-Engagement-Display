========================

A telemetry and command interface for operating a remote, embedded system.

Notes
=====
After installing packages, remove all folders in '/Packages/SharpDX.2.6.2/Bin/' EXCEPT 'DirectX11-Signed-net40' which is the folder that's actually needed. All of the rest are unnecessary and removing them saves a lot of disk space.
